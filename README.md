# House Price Prediction 🏠📈

This project aims to predict house prices using **Machine Learning (ML) models** and **Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs)**. It includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model evaluation.

## 📂 Dataset
- The dataset consists of various house features, including **location, size, number of rooms, and amenities**.
- Missing values were handled, and categorical data was encoded properly.

## ⚙️ Approach
- **ML Models Used:** Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGBoost
- **Deep Learning:** ANN with Dropout & Early Stopping to prevent overfitting
- **Evaluation Metrics:** RMSE, R² Score

## 🛠 Installation & Usage
